09. What is data-type, what is case-sensitive. why should use an equal operator (=) in your program?
Answer:
    DATA-TYPE: A computer does not know the difference between "1234" and "abcd". A data type is a
    classification that dictates what a variable or object can hold in computer programming. That's
    mean in programming, a classification identifying one of various types of data, as double,
    integer, boolean, or string, the possible values for that type, the operations that can be done
    on that type, and the way the values of that type are stored.

    CASE-SENSITIVE: Case sensitive means the ability to distinguish uppercase or lowercase letters in
    a computer system, software, or program.

    IMPORTANCE-OF-EQUAL-OPERATOR: An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the
    compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and
    produce final result. “=” This is the simplest assignment operator. This operator is used to
    assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.


10. what is the difference between value and variable in dart programming?
Answer:
    DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-VALUE-&-VARIABLE:
        VALUE
            1. A value is what the logicians call an “individual constant,” such as the integer 3.
            2. A value has no location in time or space.
            3. It is the actual data or instructions stored in computer.

        Variable
            1. A variable is a holder for a representation of a value.
            2. A variable does have location in time and space.
            3. It is a way locating the data, a value-replacing reference , but not itself the set
            of data or instruction stored in computer.

        A "variable" can have a "value" of "data". e.g. variable "a" has a value of 3.
